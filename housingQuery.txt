@GeorgeClancye @partlypol I do think there's a more nuanced argument about 1950s America than 'socially it was bad' vs 'perfection', largely on people looking wistfully at (relatively) low cost housing/healthcare/education to the point that a good standard of living could be had on an average income.

After years of failed attempts to pass state-level anti-discrimination laws, LGBTQ workers in Kansas &amp; Missouri have federal protections following Monday's SCOTUS ruling.

Yet those protections don't extend to housing or public accommodations

Okay, yeah the supreme court's ruling is progress, but what about housing opportunities? Medical discrimination? Jobs are not the only concern here. Especially for trans individuals. They took six steps backwards and think one step foward is acceptable. It's not. https://t.co/6za93DBLNb

@ScottAdamsSays Glad you're in favour. How about instead of reparations 'paid to individuals',instead provide funds to ensure decent housing,healthcare, schools, university &amp; vocational training. Create/fund opportunities for people. Giving people a fair chance to succeed is 'America' right?!

My skin color did not determine how hard my Grandparents, Parents, us, and children work.  For many generations we have been paying reparations in housing, social giveaways, and job opportunities, for slavery and injustices. Even though my family never were responsible. Enough!!

@andrewhdonohoe @owryan61 @gavreilly Yes SF were stunned at their vote after previous defeats. Looks like 5 more years of the same. I like Leo but there's no balls to take on the health service, housing he called a crisis 5 years ago. Insurance companies and the vampire legal profession. Unfair rent, childcare etc.

@gifdsports They may not own the buildings, but they live there, work there &amp; go to school there. It is their communities that they are destroying, burning down &amp; looting. Than they complain about a lack of housing, food stores, schools, and jobs! Who wants to invest when it gets destroyed?

It would not apply to rebuilding similar structures with similar rents
"The moratorium may exclude
actions to reopen commercial and industrial businesses and rental housing at substantially
the same level and rents as before the events."
